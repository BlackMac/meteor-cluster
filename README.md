## Are you looking for our newest project [meteorhacks:cluster](https://github.com/meteorhacks/cluster) ?

Meteor Cluster is now retired & Meteor's Collection implementation implementation with [Oplog](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Oplog-Observe-Driver) support can be used to run a cluster of Meteor nodes.

### Smarter way to run cluster of meteor nodes

#### See: [Meteor Cluster - Introduction & How it works](http://meteorhacks.com/meteor-cluster-introduction-and-how-it-works.html) article

Meteor is not a toy anymore. People keen to build enterprise apps on top of the meteor. So people need to run cluster of meteor nodes for several reasons. 

But when running cluster of nodes, meteor is not realtime anymore(between nodes). It get synced but takes few seconds.

**Here comes the solution - `meteor-cluster`**

[![Meteor Cluster in Action](http://i.imgur.com/lidwQaW.png)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12NkUJEdFCw&feature=youtu.be)

### Installation

just run `mrt add cluster`

### Redis

`meteor-cluster` uses redis as the communicate channel between nodes. It uses pub/sub functionality of redis.
So you need to have redis-server running.

If you are new to redis, [read this guide](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart)

### Configurations

`meteor-cluster` needs to know 

* how to connect with redis
* what collections it needs to sync

It just a two lines of configuration. Add following inside you server code.

~~~js
Meteor.startup(function() {
    Meteor.Cluster.init(); //assumes you are running redis-server locally
    Meteor.Cluster.sync(Posts, Notifications, Comments); //these are my collections
});
~~~

### How to scale

Just fire up new nodes and it just works.

### Tests

* start `redis-server` before testing
* `mrt test-packages ./`

### API

#### Meteor.Cluster.init(redisConfig)

Initialize and connect to redis.

* redisConfig - null or `{port: 6337, host: "localhost", auth: null, db: null}`
* alternatively you can pass redis config via `CLUSTER_URL` env variable
* CLUSTER_URL formart: `redis://redis:<password>@<host>:<port>`

#### Meteor.Cluster.sync(collections...)

Sync given set of collection between nodes

* collections... - Collections defined as list of arguments
